# 👋 Hi, I’m David Juliano

I’m a software engineer based in Boston with experience across both enterprise infrastructure and early-stage startups.  
I enjoy building clean, scalable systems that solve real problems — and collaborating with people who care about what they’re building.

## 🧠 About Me

I've led development of [Tongo](https://tongo.app)** — a “digital concierge” SaaS platform for hotels that helps properties engage guests and streamline operations.  
Through this I’ve led learned from the ground up designing architecture, integrating with hotel property systems, and building an AI layer that personalizes guest experiences.

Previously, I worked as a **Network Automation Engineer at State Street**, developing Python-based automation tools and internal platforms to improve operational efficiency and system reliability at scale.

## 💬 What Drives Me

I love the intersection of **product and engineering** — turning ideas into reliable, user-focused systems.  
Whether it’s an AI-powered workflow or a backend automation script, I care about building tools that make work (and life) easier for others.

Outside of work, you’ll usually find me **on the golf course, snowboarding, at a Red Sox game, or outdoors somewhere**.
