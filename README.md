# 👋 Hi, I’m David Juliano

I’m a software engineer based in Boston with experience across both enterprise infrastructure and early-stage startups.  
I enjoy building clean, scalable systems that solve real problems — and collaborating with people who care about what they’re building.

## 🧠 About Me

I’m the **Cofounder and CTO of [Tongo](https://tongo.app)** — a “digital concierge” SaaS platform for hotels that helps properties engage guests and streamline operations.  
At Tongo, I’ve led technical development from the ground up: designing architecture, integrating with hotel property systems, and building an AI layer that personalizes guest experiences.

Previously, I worked as a **Network Automation Engineer at State Street**, developing Python-based automation tools and internal platforms to improve operational efficiency and system reliability at scale.

## 💬 What Drives Me

I love the intersection of **product and engineering** — turning ideas into reliable, user-focused systems.  
Whether it’s an AI-powered workflow or a backend automation script, I care about building tools that make work (and life) easier for others.

Outside of work, you’ll usually find me **on the golf course, snowboarding, at a Red Sox game, or outdoors somewhere**.
